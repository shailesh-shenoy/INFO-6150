            Cats are divisive animals, aren't they? Unlike dogs who are loved by
            majority of people, cats are either loved a lot or hated a lot.
            Something about their self-dependent nature rubs people off. But
            that is exactly why I love cats! I know my cats love me and like the
            occasional cuddle, but don't need my constant attention, which is a
            blessing for my busy lifestyle. I have taken care of plenty of cats
            in my life, but Simba and Oreo are just precious to me. In fact
            their sleepy nature is what inspired this website! You are
            statistically more likely to see them sleeping than awake. This
            prompted me to I read up on the mystery of feline sleepy nature, and
            compiled the information in this website. So without further ado,
            meet my glorious cats!

          We got simba from an NGO my aunt worked in. He is a mix of Persian and
          Indian breeds, and I am glad he takes the best of both worlds! Simba's
          color and neck fur give him the appearance of a lion (kinda), hence
          the name. Simba was very active and playful when he was a adorable
          little kitten, but has quickly grown up to be a grumpy, lazy bum.
          Well, at least he is still adorable! And my cats have an instagram
          page, please take a look!

          We got Oreo from a family friend whose cat gave birth to three lovely
          kittens and were looking for a home for them when they were old
          enough. Oreo was meant to be a friend for Simba as he was getting
          lonely, but she quickly became everyone's favorite! The wonderful mix
          of Black and White fur gives her a majestic look and inspires her
          name. She is still a curious and energetic kitten, who won't stop
          breaking things. Please take a look at her instagram page!
