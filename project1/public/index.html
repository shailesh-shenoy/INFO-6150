        <p class="hero__description">
          Cat person? How many pictures of your cat sleeping have you got on
          your phone? A lot, right? Cats exhibit plenty of weird behaviors, such
          as kneading, hiding in small places and hanging out in boxes, but
          <em>averaging about 12-15 hours of sleep every day</em> is perhaps the
          strangest thing domestic cats do. Older cats may stretch this to 20
          hours per day! Old age and the folly of youth, that’s understandable;
          they take their toll. What’s wearing out the rest of them? Although no
          conclusive answers are found yet to solve the mystery of
          <strong>Cats and Sleep</strong>, there are three popular theories.

        <h3 class="card__title">Cats are crepuscular</h3>
        <p class="card__description">
          Cats are crepuscular, which means they are most active during low
          light times of day, including dawn and dusk. This is probably because
          such low light conditions are the best time for stealthy hunting.
          Since humans sleep at night and are awake during the day, it might
          seem like cats are always asleep. But the reality is that you may just
          be sleeping for most of the time when your cat is active.

        <h3 class="card__title">Cats are predators</h3>
        <p class="card__description">
          Simply put, sleeping so much is in cats' nature. Both domestic and
          wild cats are carnivores (meat eaters), and in general, carnivores
          sleep more than herbivores. Despite the long hours cats spend curled
          up in dreamland, they are but lazy — they are resting up to conserve
          energy and recharge in preparation for the big hunt. Hunting requires
          energy and then you add the stress factor of cats being both predator
          and prey, explains cat's sleeping behavior. Your cat may be
          domesticated and eat the cat food served by humans instead of hunting
          dinner, but cats retains the biological impulse of her wild ancestors.

          Cats are usually very playful and curious creatures. Shine a laser
          pointer on the wall and they will start doing crazy stunts to get to
          it! But this also means that they need active attention and new
          stimulus to keep them going. In the wild, this happens naturally by
          stalking and hunting prey. But in the safety and comfort of a modern
          house, they have nothing to do and thus they doze off till something
          exciting comes by.
