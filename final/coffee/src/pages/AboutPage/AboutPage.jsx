        We all know the role that coffee plays in our life, and we all have our
        favorite times of day or favorite people to drink it with.
      </p>
      <p className="about-page__paragraph">
        To be honest, though, that’s not really what coffee is. It’s just how we
        use it and why we love it.

      <p className="about-page__paragraph">
        <em>62% of Americans drink coffee every day. </em>They drink an average
        of more than three cups of coffee or specialty coffee each day. The
        newfound popularity of coffee drinks has sent the numbers soaring; the
        sale of lattes, cappuccinos and flat whites has increased by an amazing
        50% over the last five years. And the USDA (U.S. Department of
        Agriculture) predicts another strong increase for coffee imports over
        the coming year.

        ou’re probably in that group, yet you likely know very little about the
        beverage that’s such a big part of your everyday life. Aren’t you just a
        little curious to learn more about coffee?

        Exactly What Is Coffee?
      </h2>
      <p className="about-page__paragraph">
        Just so we’re all on the same page, let’s start with a definition.
        Coffee is a beverage that’s brewed with very hot or boiling water, and
        coffee beans which have already been roasted and ground.
      </p>
      <p className="about-page__paragraph">
        Coffee beans are sourced from coffee plants, members of the botanical
        genus Coffea. The beans are found inside the plant’s fruit, which are
        known as cherries; it takes about a year for a cherry to mature and
        ripen so its bean can be harvested.
      </p>
      <p className="about-page__paragraph">
        The plants (which are actually coffee trees trimmed to a smaller size)
        require mild temperatures, sufficient shade and lots of rain. For that
        reason they can only be productively grown in temperate areas of the
        world between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn; in the
        Western Hemisphere, that’s between Central Mexico in the north and the
        Amazon rain forest in the South. That area is known as the coffee belt
        or bean belt.
      </p>
      <p className="about-page__paragraph">
        Coffee is slightly acidic and somewhat bitter, it’s known to have health
        benefits, it acts as a mild stimulant because of its caffeine content,
        and it’s the most-popular beverage in the world!
