          There have been a lot of assignments with cats. While this delights me
          as a cat person, it is time to show the second best pet species -
          Dogs, some love! Here are some dog facts you will enjoy!

        <h3 class="card__title">Dogs have wet noses</h3>
        <p class="card__description">
          This amazing dog fact might answer a long-standing question that dog
          owners have. Why are dogs noses wet? To help them absorb scent
          chemicals! Their nose secretes a special mucus that helps to absorb
          these chemicals, and then they lick their noses to sample them,
          helping them understand what the smell is.

        <h3 class="card__title">Dog ears are also impressive</h3>
        <p class="card__description">
          While everyone knows dogs’ sense of smell is pretty amazing, don’t
          forget about their hearing! Everything from the positioning of their
          ears to the muscles in them helps dogs pick up a whole host of sounds
          that humans can’t hear. In fact, the most popular explanation for why
          dogs tilt their heads is that they’re trying to locate the source of a
          sound.

        <h3 class="card__title">Dogs aren’t actually color-blind</h3>
        <p class="card__description">
          This is one of the most common dog “facts” that are actually false.
          Despite a prevailing myth that dogs can only see in black and white,
          your pooch actually can see a spectrum of color. While they do have
          trouble distinguishing between different shades of green and red,
          which will mostly just appear as grays and browns, blue and yellow
          tones are relatively clear to dogs.
